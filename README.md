# [Road Name Remover](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/77463/Windows)
This mod provides options to remove names from Streets, Highways, Alleys, Bridges and Dams. It sets the default values for these roads to an empty value. It is still possible to manually name roads.

Per default only Highway Names are hidden. Use the ingame settings to change this. Make sure to reload the language (by switching to another language and back) to see the changes without having to restart the game.

## Features
- Configurable ingame options for each road type
- Lightweight, highly compatible
- Road names will return to original values when the mod is disabled

## Requirements
- None!

## Compatibility
This mod should be compatible with most other mods
