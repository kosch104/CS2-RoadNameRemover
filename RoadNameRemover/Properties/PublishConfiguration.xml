# Road Name Remover
This mod provides options to remove names from Streets, Highways, Alleys, Bridges and Dams. It sets the default values for these roads to an empty value. It is still possible to manually name roads.

Per default only Highway Names are hidden. Use the ingame settings to change this. Make sure to reload the language (by switching to another language and back) to see the changes without having to restart the game.

## Features
- Configurable ingame options for each road type
- Lightweight, highly compatible
- Road names will return to original values when the mod is disabled

## Requirements
- Gooee
- l18N Everywhere (for localization)

## Compatibility
This mod should be compatible with most other mods. Conflict potential with I18N Everywhere is currently being investigated.

## Acknowledgment
I would like to thank
* **CityRat** for the mod thumbnail and **Nullpinter** for their knowledge on localization. This mods remake has been inspired by I18N Everywhere.
